## Regarding the lack of tests

While this project currently lacks tests, I acknowledge the importance of testing for ensuring code quality and reliability is. Initially, due to my limited knowledge when starting the project, I didn't prioritize writing tests. As the project evolved, I decided not to invest time in writing tests, as I originally intended it to be a smaller-scale project.
