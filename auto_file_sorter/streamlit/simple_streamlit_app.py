# TODO : this run code here would need to be run as part of the process of spinning up the GmailAutomation daemon.
# The streamlit app will need to show a log of the prompts, responses and all the logs from the application like the GmailAutomation daemon.
# It will also need to allow me to interact with the gmail db and the rules db.
# TODO: I will then need to add all this functionality to the react js front end app in root/../auto-file-sorter-react-app/src/mains/streamlit_app.tsx
