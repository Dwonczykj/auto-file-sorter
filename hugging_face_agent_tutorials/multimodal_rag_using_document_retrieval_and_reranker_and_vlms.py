# # Multimodal RAG with ColQwen2, Reranker, and Quantized VLMs on Consumer GPUs
#
# _Authored by: [Sergio Paniego](https://github.com/sergiopaniego)_
#

# In this notebook, we demonstrate how to build a **Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system by integrating [**ColQwen2**](https://huggingface.co/vidore/colqwen2-v1.0) for document retrieval, [**MonoQwen2-VL-v0.1**](https://huggingface.co/lightonai/MonoQwen2-VL-v0.1) for reranking, and [**Qwen2-VL**](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2-vl/) as the vision language model (VLM). Together, these models form a powerful RAG system that enhances query responses by seamlessly combining text-based documents and visual data. Notably, this notebook is optimized for use on a single consumer GPU, thanks to the integration of a quantized VLM.
#
# Instead of relying on a complex OCR-based document processing pipeline, we leverage a **Document Retrieval Model** to efficiently retrieve the most relevant documents based on a user‚Äôs query, making the system more scalable and efficient.
#
# This notebook builds on the concepts introduced in our previous guide, [**Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Document Retrieval (ColPali) and Vision Language Models (VLMs)**](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/multimodal_rag_using_document_retrieval_and_vlms). If you haven't reviewed that notebook yet, we recommend doing so before proceeding with this one.
#
# Tested on an L4 GPU.

# ## 1. Install dependencies
# Let‚Äôs kick off by installing the essential libraries for our project! üöÄ
#

import subprocess
subprocess.run(['pip', 'install', '-U', '-q', 'byaldi', 'pdf2image', 'qwen-vl-utils', 'transformers', 'bitsandbytes', 'peft'], check=True)
# Tested with byaldi==0.0.7, pdf2image==1.17.0, qwen-vl-utils==0.0.8, transformers==4.46.3
import subprocess
subprocess.run(['pip', 'install', '-U', '-q', 'rerankers[monovlm]'], check=True)

# ## 2. Load Dataset üìÅ
#
# For this notebook, we will use charts and maps from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), a valuable resource offering open access to a wide range of data and visualizations. Specifically, we will focus on the [life expectancy data](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy).
#
# To facilitate easy access, we've curated a small subset of this data in the following [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sergiopaniego/ourworldindata_example).
#
# While we have selected a few examples from this source for demonstration purposes, in a real-world scenario, you could work with a much larger collection of visual data to further enhance your model's capabilities.

# After downloading the visual data, we will save it locally to enable the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to index the files later. This step is crucial, as it allows the document retrieval model (ColQwen2) to efficiently process and manipulate the visual content. Additionally, we reduce the image size to **448x448** to further minimize memory consumption and ensure faster processing, which is important for optimizing performance in large-scale operations.

# ## 3. Initialize the ColQwen2 Multimodal Document Retrieval Model ü§ñ

# Now that our dataset is ready, we will initialize the Document Retrieval Model, which will be responsible for extracting relevant information from the raw images and delivering the appropriate documents based on our queries.
#
# Using this model, we can greatly enhance our system‚Äôs conversational capabilities.
#
# For this task, we will use **[Byaldi](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/byaldi)**. The developers describe the library as follows: _"Byaldi is RAGatouille's mini sister project. It is a simple wrapper around the ColPali repository to make it easy to use late-interaction multi-modal models such as ColPALI with a familiar API."_
#
# In this project, we will focus specifically on **ColQwen2**.
#
# Image: ColPali architecture
#
# Additionally, you can explore **[ViDore (The Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vidore/vidore-leaderboard)** to see the top-performing retrievers in action.
#

# First, we will load the model from the checkpoint.

from byaldi import RAGMultiModalModel

docs_retrieval_model = RAGMultiModalModel.from_pretrained("vidore/colqwen2-v1.0")
# Next, we can index our documents directly using the document retrieval model by specifying the folder where the images are stored. This will enable the model to process and organize the documents for efficient retrieval based on our queries.

docs_retrieval_model.index(
    input_path="data/",
    index_name="image_index",
    store_collection_with_index=False,
    overwrite=True
)
# ## 4. Retrieving Documents with the Document Retrieval Model and Re-ranking with the Reranker ü§î
#
# Now that the document retrieval model is initialized, we can test its capabilities by submitting a user query and reviewing the relevant documents it retrieves.
#
# The model will return the results ranked by their relevance to the query. Next, we‚Äôll use the reranker to further enhance the retrieval pipeline.
#
# Let‚Äôs give it a try!

# Now, let‚Äôs examine the specific documents (images) the model has retrieved. This will give us insight into the visual content that corresponds to our query and help us understand how the model selects relevant information.

    ax.imshow(img)
    ax.axis('off')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
# As you can see, the retrieved documents are relevant to the query, as they contain related data.
#
# Now, let's initialize our reranker model. For this, we will use the [rerankers](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/rerankers) module.
from rerankers import Reranker

ranker = Reranker("monovlm", device='cuda')
# The reranker requires the images to be in base64 format, so let's start by converting the images before proceeding with the reranking.

# Once again, we pass the `text_query` and the list of images to the reranker so it can enhance the retrieved context. This time, instead of using the 3 previously retrieved documents, we will return only 1. If you look at the results, you‚Äôll notice that the model assigns the majority of the score to just one image, improving the ranking from the previous iteration.

# After that, we‚Äôre ready to load the VLM and generate the response to the user query!
# ## 5. Initialize the Visual Language Model for Question Answering üôã
#
# Next, we‚Äôll initialize the Visual Language Model (VLM) for question answering. For this, we‚Äôll be using **[Qwen2_VL](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/qwen2_vl)**.

#
# Stay up to date with the latest advancements in Open VLM by checking the leaderboard [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/opencompass/open_vlm_leaderboard).
#
# To begin, we‚Äôll load the model from the pretrained checkpoint and move it to the GPU for optimal performance. You can find the model [here](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct).
#
# In this notebook, we are using a **quantized version** of the model to optimize memory usage and processing speed, which is especially important when running on a consumer GPU. By utilizing a quantized version, we reduce the model‚Äôs memory footprint and improve its efficiency while maintaining performance for the task at hand.
