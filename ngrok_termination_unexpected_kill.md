Yes, if your server crashes and the ngrok tunnel stays open, you can terminate the existing ngrok process manually. Here's how you can do it:

### Step 1: Find the Running ngrok Process
You need to find the running ngrok process using `ps` and then kill it.

Run the following command to list all processes related to ngrok:

```bash
ps aux | grep ngrok
```

This will return a list of processes that include `ngrok` in their command. It will look something like this:

```
username    12345  0.0  0.1  2432776  19528   ??  S    10:15am   0:01.23 ./ngrok http 5000
username    12346  0.0  0.0  2432784   1952   ??  S    10:15am   0:00.11 grep ngrok
```

### Step 2: Kill the ngrok Process
Once you have identified the `ngrok` process (in the above example, the process ID is `12345`), you can kill it by running:

```bash
kill -9 <process_id>
```

For example:

```bash
kill -9 90171
```

### Step 3: Confirm the Process is Terminated
To verify that the ngrok process has been terminated, you can run the `ps aux | grep ngrok` command again. If the process was successfully killed, it should no longer appear in the list.

### Alternative Approach: Kill All ngrok Processes
If you have multiple ngrok processes running or simply want to terminate all of them at once, you can use the following command to kill all ngrok processes:

```bash
killall ngrok
```

This command will terminate all running ngrok processes.

### Conclusion
By running these shell commands, you can terminate any hanging ngrok tunnels, which will allow you to launch ngrok again or restart your Flask server with a new tunnel.
